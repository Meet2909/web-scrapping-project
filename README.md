# web-scrapping-project

This is my first project in Python.
Automating Weather Updates: A PythonBased Approach to Web Scraping and Email Notications, by employing web scraping techniques and email notications, we can efciently gather and disseminate weather information to users. This automation enhances accessibility and ensures timely updates.
This project includes installing essential libraries such as Beautiful Soup, Requests, and smtplib for email notications. A proper setup ensures smooth execution of our web scraping scripts.
Once we have scraped the data, we can use smtplib to send automated email notications. This allows users to receive timely weather updates directly in their inbox. Customizing the email content enhances user engagement and satisfaction.
